Background

\begin_layout Subsection
Place fields and place cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hippocampus of the brain is responsible for several functions including
 memory consolidation, navigation, location and spatial awareness.
 Certain regions of the hippocampus consists of specialized cells known
 as pyramidal cells, some of which act as place cells.
 Place cells are cells that exhibit activity only when the animal passes
 through specific locations in its environment, locations known as place
 fields.
 Place cells are usually inactive outside these place fields, and experiments
 have shown that some are activated only when visited from certain directions,
 and some are more active in mazes with pathways and other physical constraints
 such as spiral pathways, than in free roaming arenas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Markus1995"

\end_inset

.
 These place cells are not independent of each other, and sometimes fire
 simultaneous with other place cells, and thus more information about the
 location of the animal can be gleaned from an ensemble of neurons than
 can be from individual cells

, or reactivation, is the phenomenon where place cells that were active
 only during exposure to their corresponding place fields, exhibit sequential
 activity in the same order during the subsequent sleep following the experiment.
 There have been several studies focused on replay in the hippocampus, and
 it has been found to occur at faster timescales, both in forward and reverse
 directions, and has also been observed during awake rest

to study data and mine for correlates in neuronal data recorded from rats
 making decisions.
 The main objectives for this project are listed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To implement a Bayesian based reconstruction method for neuronal data, similar
 to the one described in the Johnson and Redish paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 similar analyses on their own data sets with ease.

\begin_layout Enumerate
To examine the hippocampal data from the Jones and Wilson task 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, which also uses a junction-based decision making test, and look for offline
 sequential activity, both preplay and replay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To analyze data recorded from prefrontal cortex of rats undergoing the same
 test, and look for any correlates concurrently as sequential activity occurs
 in the hippocampus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research review will look at some of the existing research that has
 been done on sequential activity in the brain, most specifically at the
 preplay of cells in the hippocampus.
 Different methods and techniques that were used to observe these effects
 will be detailed.
 Preplay has been observed during awake rest periods for brief instances,
 before the rodent makes a decision at a T-junction in a maze setup
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The task described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 used a similar junction based setup designed to study the interactions
 between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during decision making.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To look for occurrences of sequential activity in the data, a good system
 for reconstruction of physical variables (primarily location in the case
 of this project, but extendable to other physical variables) must be implemente
d.
 There are different methods that are available for variable reconstruction,
 such as Bayesian method based reconstruction, basis methods, and template
 matching.
 A good implementation will require a good understanding of existing decoding
 algorithms, its advantages and disadvantages, feasibility and other issues.
 One of the objectives of this project is to create a toolbox that ideally
 allows for reconstruction of multiple types of physical variables, and
 so a solid framework for reconstruction algorithms would be needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Structure of the report 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report consists of three main sections.
 The first section looks at the existing research on sequential activity,
 particularly the preplay of cells, recorded from the hippocampus of rodents.
 A general overview of the existing research on sequential activity in the
 brain is given, and also important findings with respect to replay are
 reviewed.
 The main focus of this section will be on the experiments and results of
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who study the existence of preplay in rats navigating a maze setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second section looks at different reconstruction algorithms that exist
 for decoding physical variables from neural data, and their implementations.
 A review of two primary methods of reconstruction, Bayesian methods and
 basis functions(pattern matching), are carried out, with more focus given
 to the former and its components 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Bayesian based reconstruction implementation that was used to identify
 and study the existence of preplay at decision points is also reviewed

The third section details the methods and ways of evaluating the work done
 in this project.
 This section will review methods of evaluation implemented by researchers
 and ways to test to a successful implementation of a reconstruction algorithm,
 and how to interpret the output data as well.

Sequential activity of neurons

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reactivation, or replay, is the repeat of sequential activity of place cells
 that fired while the rat explored a novel track.
 Place fields in the track cause the place cells to exhibit activity.
 Strangely, during the sleep that followed the experiment, the same sequences
 were observed to occur among the place cells in the hippocampus, suggesting
 that the hippocampus plays a role in learning about new places and spaces.
 Some sequential activation observed during sleep and during awake rest,
 did not correspond to past experiences, but rather future experiences the
 animal had yet to experience.
 These future play of cells suggests that pathways are mentally explored
 even before are actually traveled by.
 This kind of mental exploration is termed as 
\emph on
preplay
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Preplay occurrences in novel tracks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the experiment carried out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dragoi2011"

\end_inset

, rats were trained in a linear track, until they were made familiar with
 it.
 During the sleep that followed, sequences were observed that did not correspond
 to previously visited pathways (replay), but some other mental exploration
 not yet mapped.
 In the following runs carried out, a new arm was attached to one of the
 ends.
 When the rat explored the newer areas of the map, the same sequences that
 were observed during sleep were observed again, suggesting that some sequential
 activity in the brain corresponds to future play, rather than all past
 experiences.
 The experiment carried out here shows the nature of preplay and how they
 could actually be a way of exploration by the brain, and preparation to
 learn new memories

Preplay occurrences at decision points

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, the study carried out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 on the presence of sequential activity at critical decision points is reviewed.
 The experiment was carried out on place cells from the CA3 region of the
 hippocampus of rodents, running in a maze of approximately 165 x 165 cm
 large.
 There are two main lap-based tasks in the experiment, both of which are
 based on T-type junctions which the rat has to navigate through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
T-based tasks
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first task, the multiple T-task (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "fig:Mutiple-T-task"

\end_inset

), consists of four T-junctions that the animal has to navigate.
 This task is identical to the one devised in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Schmitzer-Torbert2004"

\end_inset

.
 The first three junctions are of low importance, as they merely lead to
 dead ends which the animal can recover easily from, but the final decision
 is critical, as it chooses one of two return rails back to the start point.
 Both the return rails have feeders where the animal is delivered food pellets
 as rewards, but only the feeders on one return rail are activated during
 training and the actual runs, thus making one path the positive path and
 the other one negative.

 return rails that end back to the initial position.
 Like the previously described task, only one of the return rails is reinforced
 with a reward.
 In this task however, a audible cue is delivered to help guide the rat
 to make the right decision at the junction point.
 A tone is played at the central arm before the junction in either a high
 or low frequency, corresponding to left and right respectively.
 If the rat makes the right decision based on this cue, then the same cue
 is played again as it begins its run down the return rail.
 If it does not hear the tone the second time, it implies that the decision
 was made incorrectly, and is on the rail that does not provided reward.

\begin_layout Subsection
Reconstruction & Forward sweeps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the location encoded by the place cells, a Bayesian reconstruction
 method was used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

, which is discussed in detail in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Decoding-neuronal-activity"

\end_inset

.
 The reconstruction algorithms were suitably modified to allow for faster
 timescales, as sequential activity are compressed by a factor of upto 7
 times in the brain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euston2007"

\end_inset

.
 By decoding the location encoded by the hippocampal place cells, it is
 possible to obtain the location as perceived by the animal.
 This allows for observations of both local and non-local representations
 of the rodent.
 The choice point was defined as a small rectangular area just before the
 T-junction.
 The animal is said to enter the choice point as it enters the box, and
 exits as it leaves through the north after making a decision.
 Reconstruction yielded interesting results at the choice points.
 At these critical choice points, forward sweeps of neural ensembles were
 observed.
 If the reconstructed location and the actual position of the animal deviated
 by a fixed amount, it was classified as a non-local activation.
 At the choice points, the place cells tended to fire ahead of the animal,
 rather than behind (backward sweeps, most likely past experience and hence,
 replay).
 It is also interesting to note that, there were certain non-local reconstructio
n that did not fit in with the environment, and were subsequently eliminated
 from the data set and from further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the multiple T-task, the reconstructed position of the rat began to sweep
 forward at the choice point of the final T junction, first down one branch
 path, and then down the other.
 When the rats were first introduced to the environment, their performance
 was merely based on chance, but as the number of laps progressed, performance
 significantly improved.
 In the cued-choice task, described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:T-based-tasks"

\end_inset

, it was observed that the rats chose the right path 
\begin_inset Formula $70\%$
\end_inset

 of the time based on the cue signal, and on cases where the wrong decision
 was made, the rats quickly recovered once the audio tone was not played
 at the secondary sites.
 Forward sweeps were observed at this point as well, when the animal realizes
 its mistake and begins to turn around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most interesting results that were inferred from these experiments are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The forward sweeps occur at the paths one at a time, and does not grow outward
 simultaneously.
 This suggests that the rat, once it enters the choice point, mentally navigates
 the the two branches before deciding on which one to take.
 Preplay has been observed in linear L-shaped tracks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dragoi2011"

\end_inset

, but it is interesting to observe this behavior at critical decision points,
 such as the T-junction, as this gives an idea of the role of hippocampus
 in navigation and prediction, and how it may be aid in the decision making
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the analysis carried out in this paper, the correlation between the direction
s of the forward sweeps and actual turn decision made by the animal in the
 cued-choice task was studied.
 Despite there being a link between the direction of forward sweeps and
 the orientation of motion, there were also turns when these two directions
 did not agree with each other.
 This supports the idea that the hippocampus does not play a role in the
 actual process of decision making, but simply 'plays out' predictions and
 mentally explores the map.
 Analysis of these predictions, and the decision making process based on
 these mental explorations, are carried out by another part of the brain,
 the prefrontal cortex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The reconstruction framework implemented works really well to predict the
 local representation of the animal, and during non-local representations,
 it fades away as the sweep progresses.
 The places cells initially encode strongly the location of the rat at beginning
 of the sweep, and smoothly decreases as it progresses.
 There were also representations that did not fit in with the map of the
 environment.
 While they more likely caused by noise in the data, they were eliminated
 from further analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the above reasons mentioned, it would be very interesting to look for
 similar sequential activity in the data recorded from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Jones2005"

\end_inset

.
 The task conducted is very similar to the T-based task mentioned in the
 Johnson and Redish paper.
 It consists of a forced turn and a decision point, at which a correct decision
 would result in food reward being delivered at the end of the branch.
 In this case, the cue for the decision is which of the two starting points
 it begins from.
 Just like in this paper, the rats were shown to slow down as it entered
 the choice point, before it proceeded to make a decision.
 In the case that it goes down the wrong path and finds no reward, it retraces
 its steps back to the junction and through to the other end.
 As this task is very similar to the Johnson and Redish task, it is extremely
 likely that preplay occurrences can be found in the data, which is one
 of the objectives of the project, and confirm the findings of this paper,
 and perhaps find other interesting correlates.

Decoding neuronal activity
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "chap:Decoding-neuronal-activity"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decoding is of particular importance to understanding how physical variables
 experienced by an animal is encoded in the brain.
 Different regions of the brain encode information responsible for different
 physical variables, such as the movement of an object observed visually
 and the animals awareness of its location in the environment.
 Decoding, also known as reconstruction, is the process of calculating these
 physical variables based on observed neural activity from different regions
 of the brain.
 For these reasons, decoding of neural activity is known as an inverse problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this particular project, decoding the location of the animal based on
 the neural activity in the hippocampus is the primary focus.
 The hippocampus is responsible for encoding locational awareness of the
 animal.
 They consist of place cells, neurons that show bursts of activity when
 exposed to their corresponding place fields.
 Place fields are small areas in the environment within which the place
 cells show activity.
 Usually, place cells are silent for most of the remaining area, except
 when the animal is in the place fields 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Diba2007"

\end_inset

.
 When trying to decode the location of the animal from neurons, place cells
 are used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several methods that are used for reconstruction, the two main
 widely used methods are linear based basis functions and probabilistic
 based Bayesian classification methods.
 These two methods were studied previously 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

.
 Though this section will focus mostly on the work on reconstruction carried
 out by Zhang et al., it may not be absolutely suitable for the case of this
 project, as the primary objective is to look for existence of non-local
 reconstruction.
 Non-local reconstruction is different from sequential activity driven by
 sensory input in a number of ways, most critical being the timescales at
 which it occurs in.
 This section details methods on deconstruction algorithms as shown by Zhang
 et al.
 and more specific for sequential activity, the methods mentioned by Johnson
 and Redish

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any kind of reconstruction method, the firing rates and tuning properties
 of the neurons must be quantified.
 Place cells simply fire at different times, and to make sense of it all,
 data processing must be carried out.
 By finding out properties like firing rates and cell occupancy, we can
 glean more information about place cells than just mere timing information.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For place cell reconstruction, the position of the animal is discretized
 into bins and sampled at a constant frequency.
 The position of the animal is represented by two variables, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, but for reconstruction purposes they are represented by a position vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 It is more easier to to have a single variable for reconstruction, instead
 of two or more variables, as the system tends to get more complex and may
 not yield particularly accurate results.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 of the animal was discretized onto a 
\begin_inset Formula $256\times256$
\end_inset

 grid sampled at a frequency of 20Hz.
 Most reconstruction methods discretize the data into a simple resolution
 of the order of several hundred units.
 By discretizing the area into bins, we can calculate the probability that
 the animal can be found in a bin at any given time.
 This is known as spatial occupancy, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $P(x)$
\end_inset

.
 For each bin, 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 refers to the number of instances the animal was found at the bin corresponding
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of times a neuron fires in a specific unit of time is known as
 the firing rate, or the tuning function of the neuron.
 Both the firing rate, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, and the spatial occupancy, are required for reconstruction.
 Since the location of the animal is now discretized and not continuous,
 it is possible to count the number of spikes that occur at a specific 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, here denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $S(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Given the frequency of sampling 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta t$
\end_inset

, and the spatial occupancy 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, the average firing rate at position 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 can be calculated as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{S(\mathbf{x})}{N(\mathbf{x})\Delta t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above two distributions hold enough information to allow for basic decoding.
 The spatial occupancy tells how likely the animal visits the location bin,
 and the firing rate gives the behavior of the neuron, while the animal
 was in the specific location bin.
 Multiplying the frequency of sampling with the number of instances the
 animal was found at

 The firing rate distribution at any location is not affected by the total
 duration of the experiment or the total time spent on other locations,
 but instead only reflects the number of times it fires when the animal
 was present at that location.
 Similarly, the mean firing rate across all positions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 can also be calculated
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f_{mean}=\frac{\sum_{\mathbf{x}}S(\mathbf{x})}{\sum_{\mathbf{x}}N(\mathbf{x})\Delta t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\mathbf{x}}S(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 represents the total number of spikes at all locations, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\mathbf{x}}N(\mathbf{x})\Delta t$
\end_inset

 represents the total duration of the experimental recording.
 Given this information, it is possible to define a spike as an event, and
 calculate the probability of the animal being found at a specific location
 given the knowledge that the spike occurs, through conditional probability.
 As shown by Zhang et al.,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{x}|'spike')=\frac{S(\mathbf{x})}{\sum_{\mathbf{x}}S(\mathbf{x})}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the knowledge that a spike occurs for a cell, we can estimate a distributio
n of the places where it is most likely to have been fired in, and hence,
 in essence, provide the location of the animal.
 A single cell is never enough for successful reconstruction, but this is
 the basis of most reconstruction methods, that apply the same idea on ensembles
 of neurons and not single cells.
 Given these new variables, it is now possible to define the firing rate
 as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{mean}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{x}|'spike')$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(\mathbf{x})=f_{mean}\frac{P(\mathbf{x}|'spike')}{P(\mathbf{x})}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these properties have been found by discretizing the map and time into
 constant bins, and are crucial for any reconstruction method, as they encode
 information about the nature of firing of place cells and movement and
 speed of the animal.
 The regions of high activity, both by definition of neural activity, and
 by the times it is visited by the animal in an experiment, can be identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Adaptive binning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the method described above uses constant binning, there have been
 other methods of binning used, such as the

adaptive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 binning technique described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Skaggs1996"

\end_inset

.
 In their study, which focuses on the interactions between theta rhythms
 and the firing of pyramidal cells in the CA1 region of the hippocampus
 of rats, spatial binning was carried out in a comparatively smaller 
\begin_inset Formula $64\times64$
\end_inset

 grid, in a similarly sized experimental set up, but firing rates were calculate
d in way to reduce sampling error at the cost of spatial resolution.
 The firing rate at every locational bin was found by expanding a circle
 outward from that bin until the following condition was met
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{spikes}>\frac{\alpha}{N_{occ}^{2}r^{2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{spikes}$
\end_inset

 denotes the total number of spikes within the circle, 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 being the radius of the circle, 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{occ}$
\end_inset

 is the number of occupancy samples recorded that fall within the circle,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the scaling factor that is dependent on the data (for the data set used
 in the paper, it was chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times10^{6}$
\end_inset

).
 Once this condition is met, the firing rate assigned to the bin is equal
 to sampling rate frequency times 
\begin_inset Formula $(N_{spikes}/N_{occ})$
\end_inset

.
 In this technique, the level of error depends on the overall firing rate
 of the neuron, and a higher rate implies proportionally lesser error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be noted that though this is a particularly accurate way of calculatin
g the firing rates, it's effect at faster time scales is questionable.
 While looking for local representations of location in the hippocampus,
 it can be used as a good method, but in the cases of non-local representation,
 which occurs in preplay and replay moments, this method might not be able
 to capture the firing rates at remote bins in a way that would be useful
 for interpretation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Firing rate modulation with running velocity and direction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the firing rate and the spatial occupancy vectors alone are enough
 for reconstruction purposes, the firing rate can be further be modulated
 with other parameters beyond just potion, such as the velocity of the animal
 and the direction of motion.
 In a freely moving rat, the velocity of direction of the animal moving
 does not have any effect on the firing rate of place cells in the hippocampus,
 but when the rat is placed in an environment with physical constraints
 such as a narrow linear path, the firing rate also depends on velocity
 and direction of the rat 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "McNaughton1983"

\end_inset

.
 By multiplying the firing rate with running velocity of the animal, both
 the effect of speed and direction can be modeled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the experiments conducted by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

, there was only one direction to be considered, and hence only modulation
 with running velocity was implemented.
 The modified average firing rate is now represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, which implies that the firing rate depends on both the location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and the velocity at that point of time 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset


\series default
.
 If we consider velocity and the unmodulated firing rate as two independent
 functions, the modulated firing rate is represented as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})=F(\mathbf{x})G(\mathbf{v})
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is an independent function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

is an independent function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 In the case of a simple linear velocity modulation, the firing rate can
 be represented as 
\end_layout

Basis functions and pattern matching
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the methods for reconstruction examined by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

 is using a linear combination of fixed templates or basis functions.
 The following sections describes the implementation and performance of
 basis functions as described in the mentioned paper.
 The goal of using basis functions is to maximize probability of matching
 the neuron activity.
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 is defined as the number of spikes fired by the neuron 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, within a set time window.
 For each neuron, an arbitrary template function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is defined.
 The linear sum
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i}n_{i}\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is calculated, which is distributed all over the 2d space addressed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The reconstructed location of the animal can be calculated by finding the
 peak position of the distribution.
 By finding the value that maximizes the following function, the reconstructed
 position 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{basis}$
\end_inset

 can be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbf{x}_{basis}=\arg\max_{\mathbf{x}}\sum_{i}n_{i}\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above mentioned basis function framework for reconstruction is in the
 core of other decoding techniques such as population vector methods and
 template matching methods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wilson1993"

\end_inset

.
 It is worth noting that in the case of basis functions, a single most probable
 reconstructed location is produced, and not a range of possible locations
 with different probabilities, such as the case in Bayesian decoding methods.
 While the usage of these basis functions prove to be accurate reconstructions
 of physical variables such as location, it cannot produce accurate results
 when looking for non-local reconstruction.
 This is because, there are always place cells that encode the current location
 of the animal at any given point, including awake rest at choice points,
 and they outweigh any non-local representations of location that may be
 experienced by the animal.
 Identification of non-local representations of location and identifying
 forward sweeps is a job better suited for Bayesian decoders(

Bayesian methods for reconstruction

\begin_layout Standard
This section will focus on the Bayesian reconstruction techniques that were
 studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

, and also how these methods were implemented to identify preplay 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnson2007"

\end_inset

.
 As shown in the previous section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Firing-rates"

\end_inset

, the firing rates and spatial occupancy for the animal at different locations
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 are calculated.
 The objective here is to reconstruct the location of the animal at any
 time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, given the number of spikes exhibited by these place cells within the time
 period between 
\begin_inset Formula $t-\tau/2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t+\tau/2$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the duration of the time window.
 Unlike basis methods, where a single reconstructed position is produced,
 this method produces a range of probabilities for the position, and the
 most probable position is chosen as the reconstructed location.
 Given the time window constraints, it is defined that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=(n_{1},n_{2},n_{3},...,n_{N})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the number of spikes fired by neuron 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 This method of reconstruction is based on the following standard Bayes
 rule of conditional probability,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{n})P(\mathbf{n})=P(\mathbf{n}|\mathbf{x})P(\mathbf{x})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of reconstruction is to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{n})$
\end_inset

, which is the probability of the animal being at position 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, given the number of spikes fired.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is the probability the animal is in that specific locational bin at a given
 time, and this can be calculated experimentally through spatial occupancy.
 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{n})$
\end_inset

 refers to the probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 number of spikes occurring.
 To calculate the probability of the number of spikes occurring, given the
 location of the animal, the firing rates for the different cells are needed.
 It is assumed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

, for the sake of modeling, that the firing rates of each cells are 
\emph on
independent
\emph default
 of each other and follow a Poisson distribution.
 Under these assumptions, 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{n}|\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

can be calculated as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{n}|\mathbf{x})=\prod_{i=1}^{N}P(n_{i}|\mathbf{x})=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{(\tau f_{i}(\mathbf{x}))^{n_{i}}}{n_{i}!}exp(-\tau f_{i}(x))
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{i}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is the average firing rate of the neuron 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at position 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the duration of the time window.
 Using this above expression to calculate the final probability, we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{n})=C(\tau,\mathbf{n})P(\mathbf{x})\left(\prod_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}(\mathbf{x})^{n_{i}}\right)exp\left(-\tau\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}(\mathbf{x})\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To calculate the reconstructed position, the probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{n})$
\end_inset

 is calculated at each location bin, given the number of spikes that were
 fired within the time window.
 From the distribution, the peak is taken as the final reconstructed position
 of the animal.
 By increasing the time window 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 forward, the location of the animal throughout the run can be reconstructed.

\begin_layout Standard
By assuming a Poisson distribution for the firing behavior of the neurons,
 it implies that the neurons behave as randomly as possible, and there is
 no underlying control.
 Due to this reason, modeling the behavior using a Poisson distribution
 does not capture the 'bursts' of neuronal activity that is often associated
 with hippocampal pyramidal cells.
 Also, it fails to capture the brief periods of inactivity that is commonly
 observed in these place cells.
 Despite these incompatibilities, modeling the behavior using a Poisson
 distribution works well for reconstruction purposes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The assumption that the cells fire independently and do not fire simultaneously
 is not entirely true, but only a small fraction of cells fire together.
 Because of its convenience and relatively little impact on reconstruction
 performance, it is assumed that the firing rates of the neurons are not
 dependent on each other

Fast timescale reconstruction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Observing sequential activity in the brain during offline states (as is
 the case in studying preplay and replay activities in the hippocampus),
 both during sleep and awake rest, are different from observing the same
 during actual activity in real time.
 Studies have shown that the timescale of sweeps in the hippocampus during
 sleep are reduced by a factor of up to 
\begin_inset Formula $6-7$
\end_inset

 times 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Euston2007"

\end_inset

.
 This is because, in an experimental run, the animal is restricted by physical
 constraints, such as barriers and paths, and is also limited by the the
 velocity with which it can move or run in.
 In the case of offline activity, the animal is not restricted by these
 constraints and thus, activity occurs at much smaller timescales.
 The Bayesian reconstruction implementation in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnson2007"

\end_inset

 takes this into account, and allows for multiple timescales, as it primarily
 looks for the existence of sequential activity in the brain during awake
 rest before decision making.
 Similar to the previously mentioned implementation, it is used to reconstruct
 the location of the animal, here denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}_{t}$
\end_inset

, given any time t and the spiking activity 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 This implementation consists of two parts, one that reconstructs the location
 based on previous spiking activity, using a dynamic state model, and one
 that corrects the prediction according to new spikes that were fired.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
p(\vec{x}_{t}|S_{t-1})=\int p(\vec{x_{t}}|\vec{x}_{t-1})_{eff}p(\vec{x}_{t-1}|S_{t-1})d\vec{x}_{t-1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above equation is the predictive component of the implementation, and
 finds the location of the animal based on the previous position probability
 estimate.
 It predicts the current position of the animal based on the knowledge of
 previous spikes, upto 
\begin_inset Formula $t-1$
\end_inset

, and the knowledge of the previous location.
 The physical constraint is particularly useful as the rat cannot move more
 than a fixed distance in a short interval of time, and thus can be used
 to localize the reconstruction even further.
 The second component seeks to correct this probability based on the newer
 spike observations, those at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 , as given below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P(\vec{x}_{t}|S_{t})=\left(\frac{p(\vec{s}_{t}|\vec{x}_{t})p(\vec{x}_{t}|S_{t-1})}{p(\vec{s}_{t}|S_{t-1})}\right)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{s}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the number of spike observations at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, considering 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{t}=\{s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},...,s_{t}\}$
\end_inset

, which is the spiking history of the neurons.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\vec{x}_{t}|\vec{x}_{t-1})$
\end_inset

 gives the probability of the position 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}_{t}$
\end_inset

 being occupied based on the knowledge of its previous position.
 This expression can be extended to allow reconstruction ahead of up to
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 spaces, by adding in a scaling factor 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

Toolbox implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no freely available simple tool that can allow neuroscience to
 study sequential activity from recorded neural data easily, and hence the
 project objective of designing and implementing a MATLAB toolbox.
 For such a Bayesian based reconstruction bare-bones implementation, there
 are only a few core methods that would be needed.
 Gathering from the above cited equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Zhang1998,Johnson2007,Johnson2008"

\end_inset

, a basic implementation would require the calculation of firing rates and
 spatial occupancy (Equation 3.1 and 3.2).
 These two distributions are used to calculate dynamically the reconstructed
 position based on past spiking history and position (Equations 3.15, 3.16)
 and extend the decoded estimation up to several time steps (Equation 3.17).
 To calculate the final estimated position, data from the time window around
 it is used (Equation 3.13).
 The peak of this distribution is then estimated (Equation 3.14).
 These are the core functions that are required for a basic reconstruction
 system.
 However, other details like noise removal and data per-processing must
 be carried out to improve the performance of the system.

\begin_layout Chapter
Evaluation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principal component of this project is the reconstruction algorithm
 implementation.
 The reconstruction aims to decode the physical location of the animal based
 on neural data alone recorded.
 The most straightforward way to check the accuracy of the implementation
 would be to compare the reconstructed location with the actual location
 of the animal.
 In the methods discussed in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Decoding-neuronal-activity"

\end_inset

, location was encoded as a vector of both the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 co-ordinates.
 To check the accuracy of the reconstruction, the co-ordinates are compared
 with the reconstructed co-ordinates individually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary detail that can be evaluated is how well the reconstruction
 algorithm reproduces the location of the animal.
 A good implementation will be able to predict the location of the animal
 with a high degree of accuracy.
 This depends on several factors like noise and the accuracy of the algorithms
 implemented.
 Neural data tends to have a lot of noisy data and erratic jumps, and may
 hinder performance of the reconstruction.
 It must also be noted that local reconstruction is different from non-local
 reconstruction.
 The implementation must be able to differentiate between local and non-local
 representation, and ignore any physical constraints the system uses to
 restrain local representation of the animal.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as neural ensembles sweep backwards during sleep, replaying past experience
s as a way of consolidating memory, sequential activity has been observe
 red ahead of the animal as well.
 This preplay of place cells before actually navigating the trajectories
 has been observed in both linear novel tracks with forced turns 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Dragoi2011"

\end_inset

, and also in lap-based decision based tasks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Johnson2007"

\end_inset

.
 Preplay seems to indicate that the hippocampus plays a major role in predicting
 outcomes by mentally exploring different pathways and options, before the
 decision making process.
 To study these, a good reconstruction system will be required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any reconstruction method cannot be used, as the timescales of sequential
 activity in the brain is greatly compressed.
 Because of which, Bayesian classifiers working at fast time scales prove
 most useful.
 The task described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Jones2005"

\end_inset

 was actually designed to study the neural interactions between the hippocampus
 and prefrontal cortex, but uses a very similar setup to the one mentioned
 in the Johnson and Redish experiment.
 It consists of a T-junction, and has to decide on an action based on a
 cue, which in this case was the direction of the starting position.
 It is extremely probable that the existence of preplay will be found in
 the neural data recorded for this task as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the existence of literature on different methods and its implementations
, there have been no easy to use and free tools to allow non-technical users
 to study neural data for analysis, because of which a lot of potential
 areas have yet to be explored.
 By developing a toolkit that can be easily modified for different algorithms
 and methods, we can enable common users to easily and quickly use reconstructio
n methods to search for patterns and other experiments.
