Executive summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the many functions of the hippocampus in the brain, a major role is
 the consolidation of new memories and it is also responsible for spatial
 memory and navigation.
 Certain cells in the hippocampus are responsible for encoding the location
 of the animal in the environment.
 These ‘place’ cells are active only in certain specific areas of the map,
 known as ‘place’ fields, and by analysing the activity of an ensemble of
 place cells, it is possible to reconstruct the location of the animal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reconstruction, or decoding, is an inverse problem, where physical variables
 experienced by the animal are calculated based on neural activity.
 Reconstruction of location will provide an insight into how the location
 of the animal is encoded within the brain, and how this affects the decision
 making process.
 It has been known that the hippocampus aids the prefrontal cortex to carry
 out decisions, but observing sequential activity in the brain through reconstru
ction will give a better picture as to how it evaluates actions of consequences.
 There are no freely available tools that allow users to analyse and allow
 for reconstruction of physical variables, and this project aims to make
 a toolbox that can enable users to decode neural data easily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A part of this project is research into the different methods of reconstruction
 that is available, and implementation of methods into a usable toolkit.
 The toolkit should be modifiable and compatible with other kinds of data,
 and should ideally also allow for reconstruction of other physical variables,
 and not just limited to location.
 Thus, the implementation is not for a one-time use, but rather a multipurpose
 adjustable tool that can be used by neuroscientists to decode many kinds
 of physical variables through a user-friendly graphical interface.
 It has been shown (Johnson & Redish, 2007) that rats undertaking decisions
 in a maze tend to slow down before the branch point, and neural data shows
 that place cells encoding locations sweep forward, indicating that the
 animal predicts and imagines itself at paths it has not yet explored.
 This interesting observation suggests how the animal evaluates its actions
 and decisions before a choice point.

\lang english
The hippocampus of the brain is responsible for several functions including
 memory consolidation, navigation, location and spatial awareness.
 Certain regions of the hippocampus consists of specialized cells known
 as pyramidal cells, some of which act as place cells.
 Place cells are cells that exhibit activity only when the animal passes
 through specific locations in its environment, locations known as place
 fields.
 Place cells are usually inactive outside these place fields, and experiments
 have shown that some are activated only when visited from certain directions,
 and some are more active in mazes with pathways and other physical constraints
 such as spiral pathways, than in free roaming arenas

.
 These place cells are not independent of each other, and sometimes fire
 simultaneous with other place cells, and thus more information about the
 location of the animal can be gleaned from an ensemble of neurons than
 can be from individual cells
