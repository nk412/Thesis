\begin_layout Subsection
Place fields and place cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hippocampus of the brain is responsible for several functions including
 memory consolidation, navigation, location and spatial awareness.
 Certain regions of the hippocampus consists of specialized cells known
 as pyramidal cells, some of which act as place cells.
 Place cells are cells that exhibit activity only when the animal passes
 through specific locations in its environment, locations known as place
 fields.
 Place cells are usually inactive outside these place fields, and experiments
 have shown that some are activated only when visited from certain directions,
 and some are more active in mazes with pathways and other physical constraints
 such as spiral pathways, than in free roaming arenas 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Markus1995"

\end_inset

.
 These place cells are not independent of each other, and sometimes fire
 simultaneous with other place cells, and thus more information about the
 location of the animal can be gleaned from an ensemble of neurons than
 can be from individual cells

, or reactivation, is the phenomenon where place cells that were active
 only during exposure to their corresponding place fields, exhibit sequential
 activity in the same order during the subsequent sleep following the experiment.
 There have been several studies focused on replay in the hippocampus, and
 it has been found to occur at faster timescales, both in forward and reverse
 directions, and has also been observed during awake rest

 The sequence of firing of place cells during a novel run has been shown
 to correspond to sequential activity recorded even before it was navigated.
 It has been observed in maze based tasks that require the rodent to make
 a decision at a junction

to study data and mine for correlates in neuronal data recorded from rats
 making decisions.
 The main objectives for this project are listed below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To implement a Bayesian based reconstruction method for neuronal data, similar
 to the one described in the Johnson and Redish paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and subsequently develop a toolbox that allows users to easily perform
 similar analyses on their own data sets with ease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To examine the hippocampal data from the Jones and Wilson task 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jones2005"

\end_inset

, which also uses a junction-based decision making test, and look for offline
 sequential activity, both preplay and replay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To analyze data recorded from prefrontal cortex of rats undergoing the same
 test, and look for any correlates concurrently as sequential activity occurs
 in the hippocampus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research review will look at some of the existing research that has
 been done on sequential activity in the brain, most specifically at the
 preplay of cells in the hippocampus.
 Different methods and techniques that were used to observe these effects
 will be detailed.
 Preplay has been observed during awake rest periods for brief instances,
 before the rodent makes a decision at a T-junction in a maze setup
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Johnson2007"

\end_inset

.
 The task described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jones2005"

\end_inset

 used a similar junction based setup designed to study the interactions
 between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during decision making.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To look for occurrences of sequential activity in the data, a good system
 for reconstruction of physical variables (primarily location in the case
 of this project, but extendable to other physical variables) must be implemente
d.
 There are different methods that are available for variable reconstruction,
 such as Bayesian method based reconstruction, basis methods, and template
 matching.
 A good implementation will require a good understanding of existing decoding
 algorithms, its advantages and disadvantages, feasibility and other issues.
 One of the objectives of this project is to create a toolbox that ideally
 allows for reconstruction of multiple types of physical variables, and
 so a solid framework for reconstruction algorithms would be needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Structure of the report 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This report consists of three main sections.
 The first section looks at the existing research on sequential activity,
 particularly the preplay of cells, recorded from the hippocampus of rodents.
 A general overview of the existing research on sequential activity in the
 brain is given, and also important findings with respect to replay are
 reviewed.
 The main focus of this section will be on the experiments and results of
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, who study the existence of preplay in rats navigating a maze setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second section looks at different reconstruction algorithms that exist
 for decoding physical variables from neural data, and their implementations.
 A review of two primary methods of reconstruction, Bayesian methods and
 basis functions(pattern matching), are carried out, with more focus given
 to the former and its components 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

.
 Bayesian based reconstruction implementation that was used to identify
 and study the existence of preplay at decision points is also reviewed

The third section details the methods and ways of evaluating the work done
 in this project.
 This section will review methods of evaluation implemented by researchers
 and ways to test to a successful implementation of a reconstruction algorithm,
 and how to interpret the output data as well.

Sequential activity of neurons

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reactivation, or replay, is the repeat of sequential activity of place cells
 that fired while the rat explored a novel track.
 Place fields in the track cause the place cells to exhibit activity.
 Strangely, during the sleep that followed the experiment, the same sequences
 were observed to occur among the place cells in the hippocampus, suggesting
 that the hippocampus plays a role in learning about new places and spaces.
 Some sequential activation observed during sleep and during awake rest,
 did not correspond to past experiences, but rather future experiences the
 animal had yet to experience.
 These future play of cells suggests that pathways are mentally explored
 even before are actually traveled by.
 This kind of mental exploration is termed as 
\emph on
preplay
\emph default

\begin_layout Section
Preplay occurrences in novel tracks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the experiment carried out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dragoi2011"

\end_inset

, rats were trained in a linear track, until they were made familiar with
 it.
 During the sleep that followed, sequences were observed that did not correspond
 to previously visited pathways (replay), but some other mental exploration
 not yet mapped.
 In the following runs carried out, a new arm was attached to one of the
 ends.
 When the rat explored the newer areas of the map, the same sequences that
 were observed during sleep were observed again, suggesting that some sequential
 activity in the brain corresponds to future play, rather than all past
 experiences.
 The experiment carried out here shows the nature of preplay and how they
 could actually be a way of exploration by the brain, and preparation to
 learn new memories

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, the study carried out by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 on the presence of sequential activity at critical decision points is reviewed.
 The experiment was carried out on place cells from the CA3 region of the
 hippocampus of rodents, running in a maze of approximately 165 x 165 cm
 large.
 There are two main lap-based tasks in the experiment, both of which are
 based on T-type junctions which the rat has to navigate through.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
T-based tasks
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:T-based-tasks"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first task, the multiple T-task (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mutiple-T-task"

\end_inset

), consists of four T-junctions that the animal has to navigate.
 This task is identical to the one devised in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Schmitzer-Torbert2004"

\end_inset

.
 The first three junctions are of low importance, as they merely lead to
 dead ends which the animal can recover easily from, but the final decision
 is critical, as it chooses one of two return rails back to the start point.
 Both the return rails have feeders where the animal is delivered food pellets
 as rewards, but only the feeders on one return rail are activated during
 training and the actual runs, thus making one path the positive path and
 the other one negative.

The second task, is a cued-choice task (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), which consists of a single T-junction in which both the branches are
 return rails that end back to the initial position.
 Like the previously described task, only one of the return rails is reinforced
 with a reward.
 In this task however, a audible cue is delivered to help guide the rat
 to make the right decision at the junction point.
 A tone is played at the central arm before the junction in either a high
 or low frequency, corresponding to left and right respectively.
 If the rat makes the right decision based on this cue, then the same cue
 is played again as it begins its run down the return rail.
 If it does not hear the tone the second time, it implies that the decision
 was made incorrectly, and is on the rail that does not provided reward.

\begin_layout Subsection
Reconstruction & Forward sweeps
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find the location encoded by the place cells, a Bayesian reconstruction
 method was used 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhang1998"

\end_inset

, which is discussed in detail in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Decoding-neuronal-activity"

\end_inset

.
 The reconstruction algorithms were suitably modified to allow for faster
 timescales, as sequential activity are compressed by a factor of upto 7
 times in the brain 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Euston2007"

\end_inset

.
 By decoding the location encoded by the hippocampal place cells, it is
 possible to obtain the location as perceived by the animal.
 This allows for observations of both local and non-local representations
 of the rodent.
 The choice point was defined as a small rectangular area just before the
 T-junction.
 The animal is said to enter the choice point as it enters the box, and
 exits as it leaves through the north after making a decision.
 Reconstruction yielded interesting results at the choice points.
 At these critical choice points, forward sweeps of neural ensembles were
 observed.
 If the reconstructed location and the actual position of the animal deviated
 by a fixed amount, it was classified as a non-local activation.
 At the choice points, the place cells tended to fire ahead of the animal,
 rather than behind (backward sweeps, most likely past experience and hence,
 replay).
 It is also interesting to note that, there were certain non-local reconstructio
n that did not fit in with the environment, and were subsequently eliminated
 from the data set and from further analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the multiple T-task, the reconstructed position of the rat began to sweep
 forward at the choice point of the final T junction, first down one branch
 path, and then down the other.
 When the rats were first introduced to the environment, their performance
 was merely based on chance, but as the number of laps progressed, performance
 significantly improved.
 In the cued-choice task, described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:T-based-tasks"

\end_inset

, it was observed that the rats chose the right path 
\begin_inset Formula $70\%$
\end_inset

 of the time based on the cue signal, and on cases where the wrong decision
 was made, the rats quickly recovered once the audio tone was not played
 at the secondary sites.
 Forward sweeps were observed at this point as well, when the animal realizes
 its mistake and begins to turn around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most interesting results that were inferred from these experiments are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The forward sweeps occur at the paths one at a time, and does not grow outward
 simultaneously.
 This suggests that the rat, once it enters the choice point, mentally navigates
 the the two branches before deciding on which one to take.
 Preplay has been observed in linear L-shaped tracks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dragoi2011"

\end_inset

, but it is interesting to observe this behavior at critical decision points,
 such as the T-junction, as this gives an idea of the role of hippocampus
 in navigation and prediction, and how it may be aid in the decision making
 process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the analysis carried out in this paper, the correlation between the direction
s of the forward sweeps and actual turn decision made by the animal in the
 cued-choice task was studied.
 Despite there being a link between the direction of forward sweeps and
 the orientation of motion, there were also turns when these two directions
 did not agree with each other.
 This supports the idea that the hippocampus does not play a role in the
 actual process of decision making, but simply 'plays out' predictions and
 mentally explores the map.
 Analysis of these predictions, and the decision making process based on
 these mental explorations, are carried out by another part of the brain,
 the prefrontal cortex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The reconstruction framework implemented works really well to predict the
 local representation of the animal, and during non-local representations,
 it fades away as the sweep progresses.
 The places cells initially encode strongly the location of the rat at beginning
 of the sweep, and smoothly decreases as it progresses.
 There were also representations that did not fit in with the map of the
 environment.
 While they more likely caused by noise in the data, they were eliminated
 from further analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the above reasons mentioned, it would be very interesting to look for
 similar sequential activity in the data recorded from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Jones2005"

\end_inset

.
 The task conducted is very similar to the T-based task mentioned in the
 Johnson and Redish paper.
 It consists of a forced turn and a decision point, at which a correct decision
 would result in food reward being delivered at the end of the branch.
 In this case, the cue for the decision is which of the two starting points
 it begins from.
 Just like in this paper, the rats were shown to slow down as it entered
 the choice point, before it proceeded to make a decision.
 In the case that it goes down the wrong path and finds no reward, it retraces
 its steps back to the junction and through to the other end.
 As this task is very similar to the Johnson and Redish task, it is extremely
 likely that preplay occurrences can be found in the data, which is one
 of the objectives of the project, and confirm the findings of this paper,
 and perhaps find other interesting correlates.
